# Bridge-Creator
Makes customized 3d printable bridges for model railroad use.

This code is incomplete. At this time only the girder bridge types are working.
This code has only been tested for use on N-Scale and a little bit for HO. Other
scales may work but have not been tested.

Printing
--------

I have the best luck printing these on a resin printer directly on the build plate. 
I have not tested them on a FDM printer. If you do, let me know. 

Bridge Types
------------

* Girder:   This produces basic through girder bridges.
* Deck:     This produces deck style girder bridges. 
          Best results are had by setting width to about 8 or 9 feet, 
          Girder_End_Radius to 0, and Bay_Count to about 8.

Deck Types
----------

* X Braced:   This produces x bracing across the whole bridge.
* Stringer:   This produces smaller x bracing just across the stringers.
* Beam Deck:  This produces many beams across the bridge and a deck for ballasting.
